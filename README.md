<strong>homework_5: Day Planner</strong>

Objective:

Designed and coded a simple, easy to use application that allows users to record their daily list of things to accomplish by the hour (between 9-5) using jQuery and moment.js.

Each hour will have it's own dedicated row which will include the time, an entry box to record the task to complete and a save button that allows the user to save the task.

Each row is color coded to let the user know if the time is overdue for the task or before being due.

The "tasks" will be stored via localstorage during each browser session.

Current day is displayed in a subtitle above the table. 

User's can erase their previosu entry by deleting the entry and hitting save.
